* 0.1.0
  * Correctly handle tables and paragraphs in lists. Before if there was a
    table in a list it would break the list into two halves, the half before
    the table and the half after the table (with the table inbetween them). Now
    if there is a table or paragraph in a list those elements get rolled into
    the list.
